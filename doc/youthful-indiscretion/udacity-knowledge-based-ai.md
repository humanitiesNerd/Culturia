## Principes

### Represent and Reason

- semantic network
- frames: reason & common sens reasoning
- ...

### Learning is incremental

- learning by recording cases
- ...
- ...
- version spaces
- learning by correcting mistakes

### Reasoning is top-down as well as bottom-up

- top-down: world -> data
- bottom-up: data -> knowledge structure -> expectation -> world

### Match methods to tasks

Methods:

- Generate & Test
- Means-Ends analysis
- Problem Reduction
- Production Systems
- Case-Based Reasoning
- Planning
- Analogical Reasoning

Tasks:

- Configuration
- Diagnosis
- Design
- Meta-Reasoning
- Creativity
- Classification
- Systems Thinking

No absolute match, meta-reasoning need a strategy.

### Heuristics to find solutions that are good enough

...

### Use recurring patterns

...

### learning and memory support and constrain each other
