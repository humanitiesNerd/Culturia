## guile-culturia

Culturia wants to be a framework that makes it easy to tape into
Natural Language Processing algorithms and provide an interface for
common tasks.

Culturia is an intelligence augmentation software.  It's primary
interface is a search engine.  Another important aspect of the project
is that it wants to be useable offline as such it will come with
infrastructure to dump, load and store dataset for offline use.

The current state of the project can be described as a big ball of
mud.  There is a tiny search engine with crawling skills and that's
basically all of it.

Culturia is a reference to
[Culture and Empire by Pieter Hintjens](http://cultureandempire.com) and
[Intelligence Augmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_amplification).
