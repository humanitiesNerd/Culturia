## guile-culturia

Create a framework that makes it easy to tape into Natural Language
Understanding algorithms (and NLP) and provide an interface for common
tasks.  Culturia is an intelligence augmentation software.  It's
primary interface is a search engine.  Another important aspect of the
project is that it wants to be useable offline as such it will come
with infrastructure to dump, load and store dataset for offline use.

The current state of the project can be described as a big ball of
mud.  There is a tiny search engine with crawling skills and that's
basically all of it.

The immediate changes that should happen are in order of preference:

- offline stackoverflow

- port whoosh to guile to improve text search

- offline hackernews, wikidata, wikipedia, wiktionary
