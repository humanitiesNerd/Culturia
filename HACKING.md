# HACKING

At some point code gets documented inline and tested. If something changes, the
tests can tell. This should serve as a basis to learn how things works even if
it not optimal. I'm not dealing with same complexity as opencog but I would like
to avoid writing books (metophorically or not) to explain how it works.

To lower complexity, components are split at the smallest possible parts.
